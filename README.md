## About Viva

The Spanish word for "live" is _Viva_. This web-app is meant to help users live through rough times and take care of themselves; the current state of pandemic inspired this idea. We wanted to make our users' lives a little bit easier by designing an app that would promote self-care. Self-care can come in the form of many things, whether it's through pampering one's self or managing time efficiently. This app focuses more on the mental health of the user as many people's mental health was affected by the pandemic. Women are almost twice more as likely as men to develop a stress disorder throughout their lifetime. Viva includes self-care and aid with anxiety for the user. 

## What it does

Wind down for the day or simply take a break, Viva is here to make sure you find time to take care of yourself. With the podcast feature, the user can listen to a motivational podcast for women anywhere and anytime. With the calendar feature, reminders and events can be added onto Viva and all in one place, at the user's convenience. There is an affirmations feature, allowing the user to find a daily set of affirmations for their desired goal, whether that's improving their health, wealth, happiness, or confidence. The stress relief section asks the user to pick what their main stressors are and provides them with helpful videos to aid in alleviating their anxiety. The last section is an Explore tab which lets the user view a list of prevalent female issues in the world right now. Clicking on a topic, redirects the user to an article providing a further explanation.
