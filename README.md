## About Viva

The Spanish word for "live" is _Viva_. This web-app is meant to help users live through rough times and take care of themselves; the current state of pandemic inspired this idea. We wanted to make our users' lives a little bit easier by designing an app that would promote self-care. Self-care can come in the form of many things, whether it's through pampering one's self or managing time efficiently. This app focuses more on the mental health of the user as many people's mental health was affected by the pandemic. Women are almost twice more as likely as men to develop a stress disorder throughout their lifetime. Viva includes self-care and aid with anxiety for the user. 

## What it does

Wind down for the day or simply take a break, Viva is here to make sure you find time to take care of yourself. With the podcast feature, the user can listen to a motivational podcast for women anywhere and anytime. With the calendar feature, reminders and events can be added onto Viva and all in one place, at the user's convenience. There is an affirmations feature, allowing the user to find a daily set of affirmations for their desired goal, whether that's improving their health, wealth, happiness, or confidence. The stress relief section asks the user to pick what their main stressors are and provides them with helpful videos to aid in alleviating their anxiety. The last section is an Explore tab which lets the user view a list of prevalent female issues in the world right now. Clicking on a topic, redirects the user to an article providing a further explanation. 

## Challenges Encountered

Participating in a remote hackathon has its pros and cons. A pro is that participants and teammates aren't limited to one city, state, or country. Whereas the con is that it's difficult to maintain strong communication with everyone in different time zones. One of the main struggles we faced was figuring out how to use JavaScript for our feature pages. In the stress relief page in particular, we weren't able to make a form assessing the user's stress, as originally planned. None of us had previous experience with the language, so we were learning as went. 

## Accomplishments that We're proud of

Each of us is proud of ourselves for staying motivated throughout the full hackathon. When we encountered bugs in our code, at the time feeling unsolvable and difficult, we all pushed through and debugged together, either with a mentor or each other. Being that we were entirely new in working with javascript, we gained experience and knowledge in this language nearing the end of the hackathon and could not be any prouder. Utilizing our time and individual strengths, we realized how important collaboration was and are proud to admit, we were able to communicate very well over the weekend.

## What We learned

As coders, we all gained experience through this hackathon. While two people worked on the back end, the other two worked on the front end but with communication, we all helped each other in more ways than one. At first, none of us knew javascript but learned along with the way when we debugged code with each other. Creating our own web app was a great opportunity to learn about challenges in the real world and think about how we can best approach a user's needs. When all of us decided to brainstorm, we all agreed that what anyone needs in this pandemic is to really take a break to take care of themselves. Placing ourselves in the seat of the user, we utilized our time working on a web app that helped us to understand what work goes into making an awesome web app. 

## What's next for Viva

We want to turn Viva into a mobile app to share with more users so that is more accessible. We plan to improve the UI/UX and add new and more features that can be specific to the user's needs. Using an API in the future, we can generate and randomize the podcasts that are recommended to a user and add local articles onto the site as well. Another touch would be implementing logins through MongoDB so data such as a period tracking calendar will be saved for any user. By adding more features, the user can get all in one with Viva!
